## Overview

This section walks you through containerizing and running a .NET
application.

## Get the sample applications

In this guide, you will use a pre-built .NET application. The application is
similar to the application built in the Docker Blog article, [Building a
Multi-Container .NET App Using Docker
Desktop](https://www.docker.com/blog/building-multi-container-net-app-using-docker-desktop/).

Open a terminal, change directory to a directory that you want to work in, and
run the following command to clone the repository.

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/didourebai/workshop3
```

## Add a local database and persist data

You can use containers to set up local services, like a database. In this section, you'll update the `compose.yaml` file to define a database service and a volume to persist data.

Open the `compose.yaml` file in an IDE or text editor. You'll notice it
already contains commented-out instructions for a PostgreSQL database and volume.

Open `docker-dotnet-sample/src/appsettings.json` in an IDE or text editor. You'll
notice the connection string with all the database information. The
`compose.yaml` already contains this information, but it's commented out.
Uncomment the database instructions in the `compose.yaml` file.

The following is the updated `compose.yaml` file.

```yaml {hl_lines="8-33"}
services:
  server:
    build:
      context: .
      target: final
    ports:
      - 8080:80
    depends_on:
      db:
        condition: service_healthy
  db:
    image: postgres
    restart: always
    user: postgres
    secrets:
      - db-password
    volumes:
      - db-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_DB=example
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD_FILE=/run/secrets/db-password
    expose:
      - 5432
    healthcheck:
      test: [ "CMD", "pg_isready" ]
      interval: 10s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 5
volumes:
  db-data:
secrets:
  db-password:
    file: db/password.txt
```

> **Note**
>
> To learn more about the instructions in the Compose file, see [Compose file
> reference](/compose/compose-file/).

Before you run the application using Compose, notice that this Compose file uses
`secrets` and specifies a `password.txt` file to hold the database's password.
You must create this file as it's not included in the source repository.

In the `docker-dotnet-sample` directory, create a new directory named `db` and
inside that directory create a file named `password.txt`. Open `password.txt` in an IDE or text editor and add the following password. The password must be on a single line, with no additional lines in the file.

```text
example
```

Save and close the `password.txt` file.

You should now have the following in your `docker-dotnet-sample` directory.

```text
├── docker-dotnet-sample/
│ ├── .git/
│ ├── db/
│ │ └── password.txt
│ ├── src/
│ ├── tests/
│ ├── .dockerignore
│ ├── .gitignore
│ ├── compose.yaml
│ ├── Dockerfile
│ ├── README.Docker.md
│ └── README.md
```

Run the following command to start your application.

```console
$ docker compose up --build
```

Open a browser and view the application at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). You should see a simple web application with the text `Student name is`.

The application doesn't display a name because the database is empty. For this application, you need to access the database and then add records.

## Add records to the database

For the sample application, you must access the database directly to create sample records.

You can run commands inside the database container using the `docker exec`
command. Before running that command, you must get the ID of the database
container. Open a new terminal window and run the following command to list all
your running containers.

```console
$ docker container ls
```

You should see output like the following.

```console
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                  COMMAND                  CREATED              STATUS                        PORTS                  NAMES
cb36e310aa7e   docker-dotnet-server   "dotnet myWebApp.dll"    About a minute ago   Up About a minute             0.0.0.0:8080->80/tcp   docker-dotnet-server-1
39fdcf0aff7b   postgres               "docker-entrypoint.s…"   About a minute ago   Up About a minute (healthy)   5432/tcp               docker-dotnet-db-1
```

In the previous example, the container ID is `39fdcf0aff7b`. Run the following command to start a bash shell in the postgres container. Replace the container ID with your own container ID.

```console
$ docker exec -it 39fdcf0aff7b bash
```

Then run the following command to connect to the database.

```console
postgres@39fdcf0aff7b:/$ psql -d example -U postgres
```

And finally, insert a record into the database.

```console
example=# INSERT INTO "Students" ("ID", "LastName", "FirstMidName", "EnrollmentDate") VALUES (DEFAULT, 'Whale', 'Moby', '2013-03-20');
```

You should see output like the following.

```console
INSERT 0 1
```

Close the database connection and exit the container shell by running `exit` twice.

```console
example=# exit
postgres@39fdcf0aff7b:/$ exit
```
